#phpstorm-theme-github-remixed-2

Get GitHub's syntax highlighting (color scheme and fonts) within PHPStorm. In this theme I tried to be as close as
possible on the original GitHub PHP colours. This is the 2014 style (mostly black, cyan, orange and grey comments).
For the 2013 GitHub style (that one with the pink comments, you remember ?) please see my other repo
[phpstorm-theme-github-remixed](https://github.com/panique/phpstorm-theme-github-remixed).
The theme contains also basic colours for JS, HTML, CSS etc. and uses - exactly like GitHub - the `Consolas` font
which is installed by default on Windows systems and can be downloaded for free for Mac OS and Linux.
This is an experimental repo, not sure if this looks like it should look everywhere on every platform.
